The Smart Bandwidth Allocation Dashboard is an interactive web app built with Streamlit that helps telecom operators and ISPs monitor, forecast, and optimize network bandwidth usage across multiple towers.

Key features include:

📊 Real-time dashboards to track live bandwidth usage.

🔮 Forecasting models (Prophet & ARIMA) to predict future demand.

🚨 Automated alerts when utilization exceeds thresholds.

⚖️ Bandwidth optimization using Linear Programming (PuLP).

By combining data analytics, machine learning, and optimization, this project provides a practical tool to prevent congestion, improve efficiency, and ensure fair resource allocation in network infrastructure.
